Roblox Account Generator
This script automates the process of creating Roblox accounts using the DrissionPage library. It generates random usernames and strong passwords, fills out the sign-up form on the Roblox website, and stores the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie and account details in files for later use.

Features
Random Username Generator: Creates usernames with random letters and digits.
Random Password Generator: Generates strong passwords with a mix of uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Automatic Form Filling: Automatically fills out the Roblox sign-up form, including selecting random birth dates.
Cookie Storage: Captures and stores .ROBLOSECURITY cookies for the created accounts in cookies.txt.
Account Storage: Saves the generated account credentials (username and password) in accounts.txt along with a timestamp.
Requirements
Python 3.x
DrissionPage library

How to Use
Run the script:
